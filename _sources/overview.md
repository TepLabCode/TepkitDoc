# Overview

## Functionalities

### 1. Accelerate anharmonic IFCs calculations

#### 1.1. Calculate the RMS of the second-order IFCs

This function can be achieved by the command:

```
tepkit phonopy rms
```

You can try it in these example folders:

- `Tepkit/examples/phonopy_rms*/`.

#### 1.2. Adjust the cutoff radius

This function can be achieved by the command:

```
tepkit phonopy rms
```

You can try it in the example folders:

- `Tepkit/examples/adjust_cutoff_thirdorder/`.
- `Tepkit/examples/adjust_cutoff_fourthorder/`.
