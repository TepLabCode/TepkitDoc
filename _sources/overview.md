# Overview

**Tepkit** is a user-friendly program for accelerating
the calculation and analysis processes of 
transport, electronic, and thermoelectric properties of materials.

---

## Features

- Calculate the root-mean-square (RMS) of interatomic force constants (IFCs)
- Visualize the RMS of IFCs in real-space
- Adjust the cutoff radius of the anharmonic IFCs calculations without repeated calculations
- Detect the duplicated jobs generated by thirdorder/fourthorder and skip them
- Calculate the DOS average effective mass from the BoltzTraP2 results
- Calculate the carrier mobility and the relaxation time using deformation potential (DP) theory
- Apply the effective thickness correction (ETC) to the properties of 2D materials
- Plot the transport property figures from the output files of the DFT calculations
- Plot the heatmap of the band structure (3D band structure) of the 2D materials
- Get the layer group of 2D materials through Spglib and derive various symmetry information 
- Allow users to add custom functions into the command-line interface (CLI)

## Requirements

As of now, this package is only supported on `Python >= 3.11`.  

The following libraries are required to run basic functions and will be installed automatically:

- `typer` & `docstring_parser` for Command-Line Interface (CLI)
- `loguru` & `tqdm`for Logging
- `toml` for Configuration File
- `numpy` & `scipy` for Mathmatical Calculations
- `pandas` for Table Data Handling
- `matplotlib` for Plotting

> ⚠️ Some commands may require additional packages, if you get a `ModuleNotFoundError` while running,
> try to install it by pip and then re-run the command.
