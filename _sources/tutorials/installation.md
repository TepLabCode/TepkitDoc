# Installation

## Steps

### 1. Download the package

Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/TepLabCode/Tepkit/releases), and download the latest release:

`tepkit-<version>.tar.gz`

### 2. Extract

Use the command or any other tool to extract the file.

```bash
tar -xvf tepkit-*.tar.gz
```

### 3. (Optional) Create Conda Environment

```bash
conda create --name tepkit python=3.11
conda activate tepkit
```

### 4. Install Tepkit

Cheak your Python version by:

If your Python version is less than 3.11, and you do not want to change it, check step 3.

Go to the extracted directory and install the package by pip:

cd tepkit-*
pip install .
